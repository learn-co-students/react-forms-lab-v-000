// This component takes one prop: maxChars which is a number — the maximum amount of characters a
// message can have. This prop is being passed in from the App component with the value 140.
// You'll find an <input type="text"> in this component. Make this a controlled component by adding
// the attributes to the <input> element. Its value should be saved in the component's state and should
// update on every change to the input. Show the remaining characters in the component. It doesn't
// matter how you render it, as long as the number is correct. No need to guard against input that is
// too long — you can let the counter reach negative values.
